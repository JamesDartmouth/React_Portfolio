            <p>
            I am a Mortgage Broker that has been working in the banking industry for the last 7 years. However, orginally, my background
            was in science and I have a PhD from UCLA in Molecular and Medical Pharmacology and a BA from Dartmouth in Biochemistry with a minor in Neuroscience.
            This is my first forray into coding, but I hope to transition into a new career within the realm of Data Science. I hope to stay within my current
            domain of finance, but am also exploring opportunities to get back to my roots within the Biotech industry.
